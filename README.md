# Trivia
Trivia game in python based on server client.

You can make multiple rooms and have mutiple players in each room.

I used tkinter for the GUI

I used sockets for the communication between client and server.

To run the code you first have to run manage_games_server.py file which is responsible for the state of the room.
To add a player you must then run clients.py file.
you can run clients.py however many times you want(according to how many people want to play)
